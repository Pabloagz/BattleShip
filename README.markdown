Backstory
---------

As I've never had any formal education I missed out on creating this 
type of exercise project. These kinds of games are common in many 
computer science beginner courses and I felt 'left out' sort of. So I 
whipped up this project one saturday and challenged my fellow 
programmers to a game! :)
